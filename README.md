Small library of useful scripts. It might not be portable and scalable, but they work for me.

To install
git clone https://github.com/mverzett/.bin.git

then add in your .bashrc .bash_profile
source .bin/environment.sh

If you use (t)csh shell type and you really want to add in your .(t)cshrc
source .bin/environment.csh
